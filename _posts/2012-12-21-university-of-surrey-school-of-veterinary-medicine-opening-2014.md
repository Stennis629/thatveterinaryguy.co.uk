The University of Surrey announced in October that it is planning to create the UK’s 
eighth veterinary school with a focus on research and an emphasis on the ‘One Health 
– One Medicine’ principal. This new £45m school is set to open in 2014 but the 
university has already seen an expansion in its veterinary related offerings with the 
introduction of an MSc in Veterinary Microbiology and soon an MSc in Veterinary 
Pathology. A welcomed improvement to the relatively few specialisation opportunities 
available to veterinary medicine graduates.

The newest veterinary school in the UK was formed at the University of Nottingham in 2006 
and was the first new veterinary school for over 50 years. Nottingham was quickly recognised 
as one of the UK’s leading veterinary schools; being placed 3rd in The Guardian’s 2012 
Veterinary Science league table. Nottingham does not have an on-site veterinary hospital. 
Instead if opts for the distributed approach across local veterinary practices and hospitals. 
Surrey is set to adopt a similar approach with cost reduction being an obvious advantage.

The University of Surrey is not a member of the Russell Group, a consortium of the UK’s 
leading research institutions, but has ranked highly overall in UK league tables; 12th in 
The Guardian’s 2012/2013 league table.

There are some fears that this may negatively affect an already strained veterinary job 
market and might discourage highly scoring applicants from considering veterinary medicine 
as a career. The University of Surrey hopes that by encouraging applicants to consider the 
more neglected and specialised routes of veterinary medicine that this will be prevented; 
only time will tell.
