A paper published in April in [Molecular Therapy](http://www.cell.com/molecular-therapy-family/molecular-therapy/fulltext/S1525-0016(17)30056-4) detailed a successful dose dependent response of a usually fatal monogenic disorder of skeletal muscle in dogs to gene therapy. The disorder treated was X-linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) which results from MTM1 gene mutations and deficiency in the protein this gene encodes (myotubularin). Dogs affected by this inherited neuromuscular disease had an intravenous infusion of a viral vector (a recombinant adeno-associated virus) carrying the correct gene.

XLMTM induces diffuse muscular weakness with respiratory and gastric compromise which is generally fatal. In human medicine intensive intervention is required to improve longevity. XLMTM is the most prevalent form of centronucleur myopathy ([CNM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centronuclear_myopathy)) in humans.

Neurological assessment, movement, reflex scores and respiratory function were all utilised to quantify the dose dependent response to treatment in the study participants. The data included in this paper show a clear improvement in parameters with each subsequent increase in dose. With intravenous administration a diffuse whole body biodistribution was attained and documented at postmortem. 

In both mice and dog models gene replacement therapy has been shown to be effective. The next step is translational to clinical trials for human application. 

<blockquote>In conclusion, our results demonstrate that systemic administration
of rAAV8-cMTM1 can correct the severe generalized muscle disease
in myotubularin-deficient dogs, defining a threshold dose in this an-
imal model, and support clinical trials of gene therapy in patients with
XLMTM by simple vector injection into a peripheral vein.</blockquote>
